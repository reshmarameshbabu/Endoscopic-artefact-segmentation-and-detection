# Endoscopic-artefact-segmentation-and-detection

- Performed precise detection of artefacts for endoscopic frame restoration, localised bounding boxes using YOLOv3.
- Predicted class labels and performed pixel-wise segmentation of 8 different artefact classes for given frames and clinical endoscopy video clips.
